        The history of sound recording - which has progressed in waves, driven
        by the invention and commercial introduction of new technologies — can
        be roughly divided into four main periods: Experiments in capturing
        sound on a recording medium for preservation and reproduction began in
        earnest during the Industrial Revolution of the 1800s. Many pioneering
        attempts to record and reproduce sound were made during the latter half
        of the 19th century – notably Scott's phonautograph of 1857 – and these
        efforts culminated in the invention of the phonograph by Thomas Edison
        in 1877. Digital recording emerged in the late 20th century and has
        since flourished with the popularity of digital music and online
        streaming services.

        In physics, sound is a vibration that propagates as an acoustic wave,
        through a transmission medium such as a gas, liquid or solid. In human
        physiology and psychology, sound is the reception of such waves and
        their perception by the brain.[1] Only acoustic waves that have
        frequencies lying between about 20 Hz and 20 kHz, the audio frequency
        range, elicit an auditory percept in humans. In air at atmospheric
        pressure, these represent sound waves with wavelengths of 17 meters (56
        ft) to 1.7 centimeters (0.67 in). Sound waves above 20 kHz are known as
        ultrasound and are not audible to humans. Sound waves below 20 Hz are
        known as infrasound. Different animal species have varying hearing
        ranges.

        Sound power or acoustic power is the rate at which sound energy is
        emitted, reflected, transmitted or received, per unit time.[1] It is
        defined[2] as "through a surface, the product of the sound pressure, and
        the component of the particle velocity, at a point on the surface in the
        direction normal to the surface, integrated over that surface." The SI
        unit of sound power is the watt (W).[1] It relates to the power of the
        sound force on a surface enclosing a sound source, in air. For a sound
        source, unlike sound pressure, sound power is neither room-dependent nor
        distance-dependent. Sound pressure is a property of the field at a point
        in space, while sound power is a property of a sound source, equal to
        the total power emitted by that source in all directions. Sound power
        passing through an area is sometimes called sound flux or acoustic flux
        through that area.
